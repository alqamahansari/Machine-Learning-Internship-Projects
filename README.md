# Machine Learning Internship Projects

This repository contains **machine learning projects** completed during my **Machine Learning internship using Python**.  
Each project focuses on applying ML concepts to **realistic problem statements**, following a **clear problem–solution approach**.

---

## Purpose
- Apply machine learning concepts to practical problems
- Work with real or simulated datasets
- Perform data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation
- Build project-level understanding beyond daily practice

---

## Projects Included
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Regression-based prediction systems
- Classification models
- Dataset preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model evaluation and interpretation

---

## Approach
Each project follows a structured workflow:
1. Problem understanding  
2. Data loading and cleaning  
3. Exploratory analysis  
4. Model building  
5. Evaluation and results  

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub

---

## Standards Followed
- Clean and readable code
- Meaningful variable names
- Reproducible results
- Well-commented logic
- Ethical and responsible use of data

---

## Note
Datasets used in this repository are **publicly available or synthetically generated** and are used strictly for **educational purposes**.
